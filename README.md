# BMI CALCULATOR

## What is BMI?

Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.


## Why should I know my BMI?

Your BMI is a measurement that is a ratio of your weight and height. It's a good way to gauge whether your weight is in healthy proportion to your height. In fact, knowing your BMI can help you – and your GP – determine any health risks you may face if it's outside of the healthy range.
